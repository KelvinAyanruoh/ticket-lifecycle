Select a topic. An end user can also specify a topic to give more information about the issue
  And after that, on the next slide, we will input all the information needed, as well as give a summary of the issue
  and hit create ticket.

<p>

<p>
As agent John, you can scroll down and observe as all those changes we were setting up are recorded in conversation format. The customer and agent can see all the conversations.
  If everything checks out, you assign the ticket to the appropriate team or agent. You can also leave a note.
